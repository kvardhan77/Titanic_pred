This project uses logistic regression to predict survivors of the Titanic crash using Kaggle's Titanic dataset. Logistic regression is chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values and encode categorical variables. Evaluation metrics are used to assess the model's performance. Future improvements may include exploring different algorithms and optimizing model parameters.
